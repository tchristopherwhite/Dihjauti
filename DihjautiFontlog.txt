Dihjauti /di:.'hjau.ti: | dee.'hyow.tee/, is predominantly based off Dwiggin's Electra with shades of Baskerville, Fairfield, and Perpetua. It is modern and stately, and like its inspirers, it has broad counters and spacing, which temper it and give it warmth, making it comfortable and well-suited for longer texts. It is balanced in all aspects, from its punctuation to its reference marks and symbols. Its design takes into consideration all extra characters for languages that few fonts support, such as African and First Nation. These extra characters, such as Edh, Esh, Gamma, Ezh, Yogh, the pharyngeal fricatives, the click consonants (which have added capital versions), the glottal stops, et cetera, actually look like they belong, as opposed to being afterthoughts. The italic incorporates a touch of Arrighi. It includes all transcription systems relevant to the Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek alphabets, as well as standard Coptic, plus extra characters for Teuthonista and First Nation. It also includes, to list a few, Egyptian-styled pictographs (where applicable), APL, a plethora of mathematical symbols and arrows, and a number of alternatives in the PUA. This is the revamped version of Dehuti/Dehjuti.

--UPDATES-- This version (3.0.0) has some spacing fixes, as well as redesigns to certain characters, those most notably being f and r (now more Electra-esque), the ezhes, yoghs, Latin Ou (Brill/Gentium influenced), the glottal stops, some Coptic, Greek, Cyrillic, and several diacritics. The diacritic redesigns (now mirroring Greek with steeper angles) are due to the newly added Unicode ones for tonal languages. These include the acute, grave, circumflex, haček, cedilla, vertical line, and a number of modifier letter fixes. Also, more new characters have been added, while others have been moved to their newly assigned Unicode code points.

Notes: 1) The superscript characters, modifier letters, and the numerators, are all part of the superscript table. 2) The bold versions of the font have some alternative/reversed characters; I did this because there is no difference in the math or punctuation symbols, i.e., the bold versions are not actually bold (with exceptions), which gives the font a better harmony. 3) The font uses anchors, which means that it will not align properly for linguistic use, or otherwise, without opentype. 4) For those interested, Open or Libre Office can access all glyphs using: Insert > Special Character.

Dihjauti includes:

• Latin, Greek, Coptic, and Cyrillic
• Redesigned click consonants that have accompanying uppercase versions in the PUA
• Redesigned edh and Esh
• Extended punctuation. For the uppercase middle dot, use (2E31). I placed the Teuthonista double bar on (2E3F). For those unfamiliar with the “reversed” question mark (2E2E), it is used for ironic or sarcastic statements. My design combines the two most popular forms for this glyph into one.
• All relevant (language specific) currency symbols, including the newest additions, such as bitcoin
• Fractions, as well as most math symbols, arrows (with horizontal extenders in the PUA), geometric shapes, and pictographs, with some alternative/reversed designs in the bold versions
• Latin superscript (includes modifier letters and numerators), subscript, and denominators, which are ordered as listed
• Old style numbers, which are followed by the tabular styles of both
• Redesigned short a (turned v), small capital r, and turned w and y, which better reflect their pronunciations; these characters are used predominantly with First Nation languages.
• Redesigned velar, palatal and retroflex characters; I included these if anyone may wish to use them, though they are, with a few exceptions, deprecated.
• Updated glottal stops. Their new design now has stems. They are (0241 & 0242), and (A7CE & A7CF) for the voiced pharyngeal fricatives.
• IPA, NAPA, UPA, & Teuthonista (Combining Diacritical Marks Extended, Latin Extended-E, plus extras in the PUA [E6C4 – E6D5]); now with Latin Extended-F & -G, and Cyrillic Extended-D.
• SIL additions: 1) Modifier letter small capital barred u (F1CD); 2) Nine-step tone markers for African orthographies (F1F1 – F1F9); 3) Retroflex D with hook (F20D), counterpart to (1D91); 4) German dictionary small capital I + schwa and Latin upsilon + schwa (F258 & F259); 5) bilabial trilled b (F26D), with added capital (E0E7); 6) Cyrillic capital and small Ghe with stroke and descender (F326 & F327).
• Small mathematical operators that correlate with vector or cross product (2A2F), plus fullwidth mathematical operators that correlate with multiplication X (2715). Now included are the remainder of the heavy versions accompanying the cross mark, or times (274C): plus, minus, division (2795 - 2797), and equals (1F7F0).
• Medieval, extra script, fraktur and double-struck letters, as well as raised MC, MD, MR, Wz, and more pictographs.
• A multitude of alternatives in the PUA, most with opentype extensions

These are my additions, which are mostly in the PUA:

• (20E7), the combining annuity symbol, is meant to attach to ‘a’, and be used with subscript letters.
• (221B), cube root, is a negative-spaced radical for use with superscript/modifier letters, numbers, et cetera. Type a letter/number, then 221B. 
• Alternative forms for Product and Co-Product that harmonize with the standard Increment and Nabla. These are in the bold version, located on the square cap and cup.
• Concerning the enclosed alphanumerics: The bold version has Mayan numbers, which are: 1 – 5, plus 8 (space), and 11 – 15, plus 18 (space); these are the initial numbers. The secondary, or right half circles, are: 1 – 7, plus 10, and 11 – 17, plus 20, with 10 and 20 being zero. The 8/18 space is for writing larger numbers, e.g., twenty would be 1-8-10, or 11-18-20 for black. Twenty-two would be 1-8-2, et cetera.
• Alternative form for (2A00), or n-ary circled dot operator, which is in the bold version; this character is part of the set of enclosed black dots/circles that get progressively larger: 2299, 2A00, 29BF, 1F78A, 25C9. White circles: 229A, 29BE, 25CE.
• Latin small letter um (A778) is designed to combine with either i, for German usage, or u, for Latin.
